# 2022 Presidential Elections Info Page

This is the result of a challenge that I gave myself, to create a quick page to consume the [API](https://resultados.tse.jus.br/oficial/ele2022/545/dados-simplificados/br/br-c0001-e000545-r.json) results from the TSE - Superior Electoral Court in Brazil for the Second Round of the 2022 Brazilian Presidential Election, trying to expend as less time as possible to create a good looking and functional page, with Material UI.
